This project contains 4 files:

### cryptopriceprediction.py
This is the project's main .py file which contains an exploratory data analysis, with visualizations, of cryptocurrency OHLC data, and three predictive models which attempt to predict future prices of Bitcoin. Before running this file, **tensorflow** and **pmdarima** must be installed in your terminal with pip. Additionally, the code will only run if the data file, outlined below, is contained in your current working directory.

### crypto_dataset.csv
This is the dataset, obtained from Kaggle, which we used for our analysis. In order to properly read in this data, the file must be contained in your current working directory before running the code.

### visual_analysis.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file only served explanation purposes for our group collaboration. It contains only the exploratory data analysis portion of our project with explanatory comments. This file is not part of our final software and was only uploaded for collaborative purposes.

### Final Report.pdf
